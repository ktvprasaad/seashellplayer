## Deployment

Procedure to host the app in the GitHub Pages - [link](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

Step 1: Add ```homepage``` to ```package.json```
```
"homepage": "https://<your user name>.github.io/<project name>",
```

Step 2: Add ```gh-pages``` and add ```deploy``` to ```scripts``` in ```package.json```
Now, whenever you run ```npm run build```, you will see a cheat sheet with instructions on how to deploy to GitHub Pages.

To publish it at [GitHub](https://github.com/ktvprasaad/seashellplayer), run:
```
npm install --save gh-pages
```

Add the following scripts in your ```package.json```:
```
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
```
The ```predeploy``` script will run automatically before ```deploy``` is run.

Step 3: Deploy the site by running ```npm run deploy```

Step 4: For a project page, ensure your projectâ€™s settings use ```gh-pages```
